# Commentary on Allen et al. 2017

## Rachael 
Allen et al. investigate graph conditions that lead to cooperation. In this context, weak selection means that the game doesn't have a big impact on reproductive success and P(A fixation) greater than P(B fixation) means that selection favors A. The authors explain that times until random walks meet (coalescense times) are based on p_ij (a step from vertex i to vertex j has probability p_ij). T (the time it takes until there is either fixation or extinction) - tau_ij is the expected time during which i and j have the same type (A (cooperator) or B(defector)?). An individual pays cost c when it is a cooperator and receives benefit b when its neighbors are cooperators. Lastly, p_i needs to be large for cooperation to occur, and they frame this in terms of benefit and cost: (b/c) must be greater than k. Interestingly, the threshold b/c* can differ even if average network degree is the same.

I think this paper is using coalenscence times (time to meet as a result of random walks) to understand how cooperation occurs in societies by using game theory (particularly donation gome theory) across a variety of structured populations represented by networks or graphs. It seems weak selection (what exactly is weak selection and why does this only work under weak selection? What is the weak vs strong selection threshold?) is important to their results and the application of this technique across the different types of population structures. A cooperator in these graphs must have a higher payoff than a random indiviudal two steps away and the two-step neighbors compete with the cooperator for opportunities to reproduce. Cooperation is favored under weak selection if benefit to cost ratio exceeds the threshold (what is the threshold?). I think the most important results are that the evolution of cooperation thrives best in networks with strong pairwise connections - showing that population structure is important. One part of this paper I would like more clarification on is the application of this to evolution. It seems the paper is specifically about the evolution of cooperation but the title and beginning make it seem like it would be more about natural selection or evolutionary dynamics in general, which they also bring up at the end. When reading theoretical papers I really struggle with how to understand the application of these models or equations and results or how it relates to the biological concept they are trying to prove. What real-world populations are these representing? Are there populations with strong pairwise connections and lots of cooperation that has evolved?
