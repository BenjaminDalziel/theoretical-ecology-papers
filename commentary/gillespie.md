# Comments on Gillespie 2007

A chemical kinetics system is not necessarily deterministic. A RRE (reaction-rate equation) may not be very accurate in smaller systems where stochasticity is important. Stochastic chemical kinetics attempts to describe changes over time in well-stirred systems. Gillespie reviews some theoretical foundations and some advances in this area of study. In terms of theoretical foundations, the takeaways that seemed the most important were that the overall goal is to estimate the vector of counts for each species at time t (boldface X(t) is (X_1(t),..., X_N(t)). The main estimation problem is to infer the P(X(t) = x, given that X(0) = some initial x vector). Since fluctuations can't be ignored, Gillespie presents SSA as an accurate modeling framework in a setting where randomness is important to the system's evolution. There have been a couple improvements in SSA efficiency, but it is still slow. So, it might be useful to use tau-leaping, which takes the number of times reaction channel (still not solid on what a reaction channel is) R_j fires in the interval [t, t + tau] to be a Poisson RV with scale parameter (a_j(x) * tau). Then the system at the next step is x + {sum over j} (k_j * nu_j).
