# Comments on Gupta et al. 1996 and Luksza et al. 2014

The first paper by Gupta et al. (1996) creates a simple mathematical model based on the genetic and amphibology concepts such as the immune system of the host, strains transmission, abundance of such strains in homogenous populations. It was interesting to see how it is possible to relate these biological concepts in a theoretical framework. The paper proposed by Luksza et al. (2014) explores the previous idea further into application. AN example is vaccine selection for the predominant strains. It would super cool if we started to model specific factors within the host that could alterate the genetic information of the virus. So, it is easier to predict possible variants and the virulance of it. An example of a factor increasing virulance on influenza virus is obesity (Honce et al. 2020). By taking this into consideration, it would be possible to create more accurate models in preventing possible more virulent strains.
