# Comments on Gupta et al. 1996 and Luksza et al. 2014

The first paper by Gupta et al. (1996) creates a simple mathematical model based on the genetic and amphibology concepts such as the immune system of the host, strains transmission, abundance of such strains in homogenous populations. It was interesting to see how it is possible to relate these biological concepts in a theoretical framework. The paper proposed by Luksza et al. (2014) explores the previous idea further into application. AN example is vaccine selection for the predominant strains. It would super cool if we started to model specific factors within the host that could alterate the genetic information of the virus. So, it is easier to predict possible variants and the virulance of it. An example of a factor increasing virulance on influenza virus is obesity (Honce et al. 2020). By taking this into consideration, it would be possible to create more accurate models in preventing possible more virulent strains.

After reading Gupta et al., I felt like I get the concept they were trying to show with cross-immunity and I thought Figure 2a was really useful and good at showing that and I also liked Figure 3 a lot. One main idea being that at high levels of cross-protection it leads to linkage disequilibrium with one strain taking over instead of multiple strains coexisting in the population. I do struggle with understanding the application of this with Neisseria meningitidis, and Figure 6 I thought wasn’t very useful for displaying the different populations structures. One question I had for this paper was what real-life differences in strains might lead to one persisting in the population vs being eliminated (for example in Figure 2a what made ax and by the dominant strains vs bx and ay)? Would it be something like having a higher R0?
What I mostly understood from the Luksza and Lassig paper was that it applied the model to be able to predict future strains of influenza which is obviously very important and useful as scientists try to do that every year when making the next seasons flu vaccines. My main question is whether this model predicted flu strains better than whatever method we currently use? Is it the same method? If not, why don’t we use this if it works so well?
