This paper explores 4 different ways to model spatially distinct discrete individuals (hawks and doves). They compare mean field approaches (I think ordinary differential equations?), patch models, reaction-diffusion equations, and interacting particle systems. 1) Mean field approach = each individual has equal probabiltiy to interact with every other indiviudal. 2) Patch models = discrete individuals into patches with no other spatial structure. 3) Reaction - diffusion = infinitesimal individuals diffues in space and only local interactions. 3) Interacting particle systems = individuals are discrete and space is explicit. All four approaches reach the same conclusion that if there is a positive density of both dove and hawk ,there will be a unique equilibrium. But when the two compete for the same resource then spoatial and non-spatial models disagree and intial densities matter. They also see that hawks reproduce faster than doves but a population of only hawks dies out which I think makes a lot of sense biologically. Notable quotes: "_We leave it to others more skilled in the study of these models to resolve this mystery"_ and "_...this figure might seem to indicate a much more exotic (or, gasp, chaotic) behavior..._".
