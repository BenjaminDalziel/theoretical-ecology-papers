# Commentary on May 1972

## Emily 
May gives an overview of how the stability of an ecological system is related to the complexity of that system, largely by studying the stability of modeled systems with various sizes and levels of connectedness. In general, there is a threshold above which too large of a connectance or too strong average interactions lead to instability of the system. Systems are found to be more stable when there are closely connected “subsystems” that are in turn connected rather than having strong connectivity among all or most species individually. I think this makes sense intuitively, since in this case, should a single species be disturbed so that it becomes extinct, the species closely connected in that subsystem may be strongly affected, but the effect on other species will be dampened as they are further down the chain and have most of their strong interactions elsewhere. If a species that is strongly connected to all or most other species is disturbed, then all of those species will have to bear the full brunt of the loss of this key species without the damping effect of subsystems.

I really enjoyed reading this two-page article and seeing the difference between how (at least some) scientific articles read 50 years ago compared to the majority of articles today. The generality and familiarity were nice, as opposed to the stiff nature of many of today’s papers. This was also refreshing since I did some work on food webs in my undergrad that used the notion of connectance to think about the stability of a system and how that may allow us to identify keystone species. In that project, most of my references were relatively recent publications that generalized results from modeling, and I had no idea that work was being done on this as early as the 70s.

May discusses stability in systems with n populations of different species. A randomly generated n x n interaction matrix will set up a system that is then deterministic. The probability that a given system generated by this process is unstable (P(n, alpha) of instability) will tend to 1 when alpha is large. Instability can also result from high connectance, C. A system with C_1 * a_1 approx. equal to C_2 * a_2 of another system means that the systems will have comparable stability. Lastly, even though increasing these two parameters will in general destabilize a system of n spp. populations, organization of the system into "blocks" is stabilizing in the scenario mentioned at the end of the paper.
